## My process

### Built with

- [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/)
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io/)
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)

### What I learned

This is the first major Vue.js project I have finished. I learned a lot about separating code into components and how to set up interactions between them with events and props.

### Continued development

I really enjoyed developing with Vue.js, but I still need to learn a lot about it, which I plan to do by building more projects with it.

### Useful resources

- [Vue.js Documentation](https://vuejs.org/guide/introduction.html) - official Vue.js documentation does a great job explaining Vue.js and provides an interactive tutorial that helped me to grasp a lot of basics of Vue.js very quickly.
- [LearnVue article on deploying to GitHub pages](https://learnvue.co/articles/deploy-vue-to-github-pages) - This article cleared things up on how to prepare my project for deployment on GitHub Pages.
